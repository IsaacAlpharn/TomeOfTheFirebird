If the target has spell resistance, you attempt a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance when the rune is discharged.If the rune is successfully resisted, the rune is expended and does no damage; otherwise, the rune deals damage normally.\n For every 2 caster levels beyond 3rd the caster possesses, the rune deals an additional 1d4+1 points of fire damage(2d4+2 at caster level 5th, 3d4+3 at 7th, and so on) to a maximum of 5d4+5 points of fire damage at caster level 11th."
