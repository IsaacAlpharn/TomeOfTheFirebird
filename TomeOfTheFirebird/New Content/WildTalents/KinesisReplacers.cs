As you learn to master the art of air manipulation, you can now choose to deal slashing damage with your air blast or its composite blasts in addition to any other physical damage type dealt, gaining a +1 to attack and damage rolls due to how easily your air blades cut through the air. You can also add bloody infusion to your list of wild talents, being able to apply it to a slashing air blast or its composite blasts. You can choose to gain this wild talent instead of basic aerokinesis.

         * Glass Cannon

Element(s) earth; Level 1; Type utility (Su); Burn —

You specialize in control over glass rather than more common earthen materials. Your crystal, earth, flensing, magma, sandstorm, shatterstorm, or tundra blasts can create glass or obsidian rather than stone or sand, adding +1 to your attack rolls and damage with these blasts. In addition, wild talents with which you could normally only affect earthen surfaces or material (such as earthmeld, shift earth, or stone sculptor) can affect glass or obsidian as well.

You can choose to gain this wild talent in place of basic geokinesis.
