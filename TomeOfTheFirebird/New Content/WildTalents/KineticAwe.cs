You create a terrifying display of elemental power. This ability functions as Dazzling Display, except you can use this ability as a standard action and you add half your kineticist level as a bonus on your Intimidate check if you’ve used gather power during the same round; doing so expends the gathered power. This ability otherwise counts as the Dazzling Display feat; feats and other effects which affect Dazzling Display (such as Shatter Defenses) apply to it, and it counts as Dazzling Display for the purpose of meeting combat feat prerequisites.
