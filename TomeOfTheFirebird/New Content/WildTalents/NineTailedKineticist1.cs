Element universal; Type utility (Su); Level 1; Burn 0
Prerequisite kitsune
You can cast a spell-like ability granted to you by any Magical Tail feat you have by accepting 1 point of burn, even if you have no daily uses of that spell-like ability remaining. You must be able to use wild talents of a level equal to the number of extra tails required to use a spell-like ability granted by a Magic Tail feat to use this ability to cast that spell-like ability (for example, you would need to be 15th level and able to use 8th-level wild talents to use this talent to cast the dominate person spell-like ability granted by Magical Tail). In addition, you can learn a Magical Tail feat that you qualify for in place of gaining a new infusion or utility wild talent.
