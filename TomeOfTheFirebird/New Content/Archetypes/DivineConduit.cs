The powers of the kineticist are known to those in power among the heavens, and the New Gods are quite aware of such unique powers. On rare occasions, some benevolent deities will bless their most virtuous members with powers unheard of among their brethren. While some do not answer the call, those that do are made champions of virtue among their element, wielding the power of the exalted in their every blast. Only the most pure of kineticists can bear such a responsibility, standing out among others are an example to all those who witness them.

Alignment: A divine conduit’s alignment must be either chaotic good, neutral good, or lawful good. If a divine conduit’s alignment changes from these, they can no longer gain any kineticist levels and lose all Su and Sp class features until their alignment is returned to an acceptable one.

Aura of Good (Ex): A divine conduit gains an aura of good as a paladin of their kineticist level.

Kinetic Smite (Sp): At 1st level, a divine conduit gains the following utility wild talent:

    Kinetic Smite
    Element(s) universal; Type utility (Sp); Level 1; Burn 1

    As a swift action, choose 1 creature within 60 ft; you are treated as having selected that creature as the target of smite evil as per the paladin class feature. You can add ½ of your Constitution modifier in place of your Charisma modifier to determine attack bonuses and deflection bonuses to AC from your smite.

This ability replaces the 1st-level infusion.

Divine Defense (Su): At 2nd level, a divine conduit gains the following elemental defense:

    Adamant Faith
    Element(s) universal; Type defense (Su); Level —; Burn 0

    Your body is suffused with raw divine power. You gain DR 1/evil. This DR increases by 1 for every 2 kineticist levels you possess beyond 2nd. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can increase the DR by 1 until the next time your burn is removed, to a maximum DR equal to your kineticist level. Whenever you accept burn while using a wild talent, the energy surging through you spills into your adjacent allies, granting them DR against evil equal to your own for 1 round.

    You can dismiss and restore this effect as an immediate action.

This ability replaces elemental defense.

Holy Healing (Sp): At 2nd level, a divine conduit gains the kinetic healing utility wild talent, regardless of their element. A kineticist must accept burn with this utility wild talent; they cannot allow another creature to accept it. They may use this utility wild talent on themselves as a swift action. A divine conduit always treats this healing as though they were using a physical blast, regardless of what simple blast they possess.

This ability replaces the 2nd-level utility wild talent.

Fearless Defender (Su): At 4th level, a divine conduit becomes immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of them gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects.

This ability replaces the 4th-level utility wild talent.

Glorious Steed (Sp): At 8th level, a divine conduit can select the following utility wild talent:

    Divine Mount
    Element(s) universal; Type utility (Sp); Level 4; Burn 0

    You gain the ability to conjure a mount, as per the phantom steed spell. This steed is composed of raw elemental power and divine energy, and treats your caster level as your kineticist level, although it cannot be dispelled. You can accept 1 point of burn to increase the mount’s hit points to ½ of your maximum total until it is dismissed. If your divine mount is destroyed, you cannot use this utility wild talent for 1 week.

Empowering Aura (Su): At 10th level, whenever a divine conduit uses a spell-like utility wild talent that affects themselves with a duration longer than 1 round (such as wings of air), they can choose to have it also affect a number of allies equal to their constitution modifier within 30 feet of themselves for 1 round per kineticist level they possess.

This replaces the 10th-level utility wild talent.
