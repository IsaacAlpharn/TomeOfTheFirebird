         * Beastmorph

Beastmorphs study the anatomy of monsters, learning how they achieve their strange powers. They use their knowledge to duplicate these abilities, but at the cost of taking on inhuman shapes when they use mutagens.
Beastform Mutagen

At 3rd level, a beastmorph’s mutagen causes him to take on animalistic features—whether those of an animal, a magical beast, an animal-like humanoid (such as a lizardfolk), or a monstrous humanoid. For example, when the beastmorph uses his mutagen, he may gain a furry muzzle and pointed ears like a werewolf, scaly skin like a lizardfolk or sahuagin, or compound eyes and mandibles like a giant insect. The beastmorph also gains his choice of one of the abilities listed in the alter self spell, which persists as long as the mutagen. He may select a different ability each time he creates a mutagen.

        Abilities: : darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision, scent, and swim 30 feet.

This ability replaces swift alchemy.
Improved Beastform Mutagen

At 6th level, a beastmorph’s mutagen grants him additional abilities and options. The alchemist gains his choice of two of the abilities listed in the beast shape I spell, which persist as long as the mutagen. He may select two different abilities each time he creates a mutagen.

        Abilities: climb 30 feet, fly 30 feet (average maneuverability), swim 30 feet, darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision, and scent.

This ability replaces swift poisoning.
Greater Beastform Mutagen

At 10th level, a beastmorph’s mutagen grants him three of the abilities listed in the beast shape II spell, which persist as long as the mutagen. He may select three different abilities each time he creates a mutagen.

        Abilities;  climb 60 feet, fly 60 feet (good maneuverability), swim 60 feet, darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision, scent, grab, pounce, and trip.

This ability replaces poison resistance +2, +4, and +6, as well as poison immunity.
Grand Beastform Mutagen

At 14th level, a beastmorph’s mutagen grants him four of the abilities listed in the beast shape III spell, which persist as long as the mutagen. He may select four different abilities each time he creates a mutagen.

        Abilities: : burrow 30 feet, climb 90 feet, fly 90 feet (good maneuverability), swim 90 feet, blindsense 30 feet, darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision, scent, constrict, ferocity, grab, jet, poison, pounce, rake, trample, trip, and web.

This ability replaces persistent mutagen.
