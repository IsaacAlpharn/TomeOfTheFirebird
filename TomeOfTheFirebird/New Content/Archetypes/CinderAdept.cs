         * Cinder Adept (Kineticist Archetype)

Contents

    Fire Focus (Su)
    Galloping Siphon (Su)
    Mount

Among the Sun Clan’s most noted champions are those who can tame the flames and bend them to their will. These kineticists are skilled riders, able to wield both weapons and fire with deadly skill.

Class Skills: A Cinder adept gains Handle Animal and Ride as class skills, but does not gain Stealth and Use Magic Device as class skills.

This alters the kineticist’s class skills.
Fire Focus (Su)

When a Cinder adept gains elemental focus, she must select fire (pyrokinesis) as her chosen element. When she gains the expanded element class feature at 7th and 15th levels, she must select her primary element of fire and does not learn to use a new element.

This alters elemental focus and expanded element.
Galloping Siphon (Su)

When a Cinder adept gathers power while mounted, she and her mount gain fire resistance 5 for a number of rounds equal to the total value of the burn cost she reduces. This resistance increases to fire resistance 10 at 11th level. The Cinder adept and her mount lose this resistance if she dismounts before the duration ends.

In addition, a Cinder adept gains Mounted Combat as a bonus feat and a +1 bonus on concentration checks due to riding. This bonus increases by +1 at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter (up to a maximum of +6 at 20th level).

This alters gather power and replaces the infusion gained at 1st level.
Mount

At 4th level, a Cinder adept gains a loyal mount. This ability functions like the druid’s animal companion ability (as described in the nature bond class feature), except that the Cinder adept always gains a horse or pony (though she can gain additional options at the GM’s discretion) and her effective druid level is equal to her burn rider level –3.

This replaces the utility wild talents gained at 4th, 8th, and 12th levels.
