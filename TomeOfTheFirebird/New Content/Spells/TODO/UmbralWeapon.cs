//DESCRIPTION

//A shadowy afterimage trails behind the targeted weapon, potentially damaging foes even when the weapon misses.

//Once per round, when the weapon’s wielder misses a creature with the target weapon, the wielder can reroll the attack.If the reroll hits, the spell hits the targeted creature and deals 1d8 points of cold damage, plus 1 additional point per 2 caster levels (maximum +10). If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you must attempt a caster level check(1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the spell damages the target.

//If the creature successfully resists umbral weapon, the spell is dispelled.If not, the creature takes damage as normal.
