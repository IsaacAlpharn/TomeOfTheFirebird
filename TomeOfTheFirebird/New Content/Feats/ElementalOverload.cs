Benefit: Whenever you have accepted at least 4 points of burn, the chance to ignore the effects of a critical hit or sneak attack increases by an additional 10%. This chance increases by an additional 5% for every 2 points of burn you accept after that. This chance can’t exceed 100%. Normal: Whenever you have accepted at least 3 points of burn, your chance to ignore the effects of a critical hit or sneak attack equals 5% × your current number of points of burn.
