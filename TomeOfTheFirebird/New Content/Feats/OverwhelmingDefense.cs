“I know it’s hard for you, but not for me.”

Prerequisite: Overwhelming soul 3rd

Benefit: You are treated as though you have accepted 1 burn when determining the effect of your elemental defense. At 6th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, you are treated as having accepted an additional burn in your elemental defense. If you have more than 1 elemental defense, you can split this effective burn between them in whatever way you wish.

Special: This feat cannot allow you to be treated as accepting more burn than would normally be allowed by an elemental defense.
