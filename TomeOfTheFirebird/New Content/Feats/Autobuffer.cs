Prerequisite(s): Burn and internal buffer class features.

Benefit: Whenever you accept burn on a wild talent, you have a 20% chance to gain a point in your internal buffer at the beginning of your next turn. Each time you fail at this chance, it increases by 20% the next time you accept burn on a wild talent, up to a maximum of 100%. If the chance succeeds, the success rate is reset to 20% for the next time you accept burn on a wild talent. This feat has no effect if you already possess the maximum number of points in your internal buffer and can only add 1 point to your internal buffer per round.

Special: If you possess battle burn, this feat does not trigger when accepting points of battle burn.
