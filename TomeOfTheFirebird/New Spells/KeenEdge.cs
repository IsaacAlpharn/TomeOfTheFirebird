//DESCRIPTION

//This spell makes a weapon magically keen, improving its ability to deal telling blows.This transmutation doubles the threat range of the weapon. A threat range of 20 becomes 19-20, a threat range of 19-20 becomes 17-20, and a threat range of 18-20 becomes 15-20. The spell can be cast only on piercing or slashing weapons.If cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the keen edge on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target.Treat shuriken as arrows, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.

//Multiple effects that increase a weapon’s threat range (such as the keen special weapon property and the Improved Critical feat) don’t stack.You can’t cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as a claw.
